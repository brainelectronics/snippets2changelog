## Enable in-place updates of a changelog file
<!--
type: feature
scope: all
affected: all
-->

The `changelog-generator` command can be used with the `--in-place` flag to
update a changelog file in-place instead of generating a new changelog file
named `*.new`.
This option is intended for CI usage as multiple runs on a already updated
changelog can lead to unintended version bumps.
This option is now used in the Github Actions of this project.
