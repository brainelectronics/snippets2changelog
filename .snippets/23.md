## Document and use no-internal option
<!--
type: feature
scope: internal
affected: all
-->

- Document `--no-internal` option in `README`
- Use `jq` instead of complex Python based `changelog.json` parsing in `release` and `test-release` workflows
- Skip building, testing, publishing and creating (pre)releases if the latest change was marked as `internal`
