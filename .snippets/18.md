[Poetry's dependency specification with caret requirements](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#caret-requirements) would update [changelog2version](https://pypi.org/project/changelog2version/) to `0.10.1` as specified with `^0.10` but not to 0.11.0 or anything else other than bugfixes of based on version `0.10`. This fixes #18.
