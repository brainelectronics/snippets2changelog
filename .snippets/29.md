## Remove print in branch property of HistoryWalker
<!--
type: bugfix
scope: all
affected: all
-->

Using the `branch` property of `HistoryWalker` in `collector.py` would print `HEAD is detached: ...` in case the HEAD is detached during a pull request build. This could lead to errors while creating a changelog with `--dry-run` and passing the output to a supposed JSON file, being finally unable to parse it as with that detached HEAD output it's not a JSON anymore.
