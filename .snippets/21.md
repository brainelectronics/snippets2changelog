## Add option to skip snippets marked as 'internal'
<!--
type: feature
scope: all

-->

This adds the option `--no-internal` to skip snippets with scope `internal`
during the changelog generation. This change explicitly does not add a
documentation to the `README` file to show and test this behaviour in a second
pull request.
